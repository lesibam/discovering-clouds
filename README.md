# Discovering Clouds
Proof of concept using Springboot with Spring Cloud discovery. 

This repository consists of two projects: The Discovery Server and The Client. 

One of the challenges with the Microservices approach is managing the discovery of web services. 
There are serveral OpenSource alternatives such as Eureka (which comes from the Netflix OSS), Consul, etc. that attempt to solve this challenge. 

In this exercise we take a specific look at Eureka and it's benefits.
